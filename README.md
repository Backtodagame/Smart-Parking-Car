# Smart-Parking-Car
This is also an Arduino project called Smart Parking Car. The maximum number of the parking place is 5. When car is coming, the LM393 sensor will detect and the servo SSG90 will take the barrier up. When the number of car reaches 5, it's already FULL and the barrier will not be taken up
